## UtilCPP

A collection of useful C++ classes and functions.

### Goal

Keeping it as generic as possible, so it easily adapts to any project. Currently there are no `CC` that needs to be compiled, just include the header files and you are good to go.

### Installation

#### Using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fabbboy/utilcpp
```

#### Using git submodule to stay up-to-date

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/Fabbboy/utilcpp
```

#### Alternative

**As long as there is no compilation needed:**
Just copy the header files you need to your project.
